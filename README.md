A basic mongo/restify-based facility data repository and API.

At the moment, this is purely for testing purposes, hence the blatant lack of structure.

### Usage

1) Install npm packages

```
> npm install
```

2) Make sure mongo daemon is running

```
> mongod
```

3) Start the server

```
> grunt server
```
